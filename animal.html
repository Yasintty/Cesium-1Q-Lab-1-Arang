             The ferret is a small, domesticated species belonging to the family Mustelidae. 
           </p>
           <p>
             The ferret is most likely a domesticated form of the wild European polecat, 
            
           </p>
            <p>
             as evidenced by the ferret's ability to interbreed with European polecats and produce hybrid offspring.
